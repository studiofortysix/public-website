I’m Warrick — the person agencies call when their Google Analytics setup is on fire (sometimes literally).  

With over 15 years of experience in digital marketing, I specialise in fixing messy tracking setups, building dashboards people actually read, and helping teams finally trust their data. My background? I spent years as a Navy electronics technician fault-finding complex systems — and now I do the same thing with websites.

These days, I run Studio 46 from my home office in Auckland. I work with digital marketing managers, business owners, and agencies who just want clarity and action — not fluff or endless back-and-forth.

When I’m not deep in a Tag Manager container, I’m a volunteer firefighter. That’s taught me a lot about staying calm under pressure, being useful in a crisis, and not wasting anyone’s time.

## A few things I believe:

- If your data isn’t helping you make decisions, it’s just noise.  
- Fluff looks good in pitch decks, not in dashboards.  
- Clients don't need more tools — they need someone who knows how to use them properly.  
- Your GA4 setup shouldn’t feel like another emergency.
