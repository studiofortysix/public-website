# What I Do

With 15+ years in digital marketing (and a background in fault-finding tech — and fires), I fix what's broken, set up what matters, and build dashboards that people actually use.

# Core Services

## GA4 & Google Tag Manager Setup
Get your tracking sorted once and for all.  
I’ll audit your setup, fix what’s broken, and implement clean, future-proof event tracking with GA4 and GTM.

**Perfect for:**  
- Businesses migrating to GA4  
- Agencies needing a hands-off specialist  
- Anyone sick of bad data

---

## Analytics Audits & Rescue Jobs
Suspect something’s not working? You’re probably right.  
I’ll dig into your setup, surface the issues, and get everything cleaned up — from duplicate transactions to ghost conversions.

**What you get:**  
- Full GA/GTM audit  
- Issues clearly documented  
- Fixes implemented (or ready for your devs)

---

## Dashboards & Reporting
Tired of dashboards nobody opens?  
I build custom dashboards (Looker Studio, Google Sheets, Power BI) that are clear, actionable, and client-friendly.

**Expect:**  
- Metrics that matter  
- Reports that get read  
- Automation where possible

---

## Strategy & Tracking Advice
Not sure what to track? Or how to structure your conversions?  
I’ll help you design a measurement strategy that aligns with your business goals and marketing funnel.

**Helpful for:**  
- Campaign planning  
- CRO & performance teams  
- KPI alignment with C-level reporting
